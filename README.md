## Help Wanted

BeeCount has been slightly re-written recently. The main change you'll notice is that the background
image has disappeared and the colour scheme has changed. This is to make maintenance easier as well
as to bring the components up-to-date. 

It may well be the case that BeeCount will disappear from the Play Store, but if this happens then
it will still be accessible via this Github repo. Obtanium will allow you to keep it updated:

## Information

This is the second version of BeeCount. The older, "classic" version can be found in [this repository](https://code.google.com/p/beecount/). This newer version has been considerably re-written so that the underlying data management and UI code is much easier to maintain and extend, and the UI has been updated.
