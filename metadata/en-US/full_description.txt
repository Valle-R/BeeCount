A knitting project helper, with the following features:

* Keep track of several knitting projects.
* For each project, track several items which need counting, e.g. rows, pattern repeats etc
* Allow counting up, down and re-setting to zero of these counts.
* Allow editing of projects to add, remove or change counts after project creation.
* Link counts together so that one increments another.
* Set row alerts and cause counts to reset at particular values.
* Allow backing up and restoring of the entire projects database. 

BeeCount is FOSS, and contributions are welcome!
